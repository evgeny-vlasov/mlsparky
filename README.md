##nmrML to Sparky converter (rNMR package)

rNMR is an open source software package for visualizing and interpreting one and two dimensional NMR data. In contrast to most existing 2D NMR software, rNMR is specifically designed for high-throughput assignment and quantification of small molecules. As a result, rNMR supports extensive batch manipulation of plotting parameters and has numerous tools for expediting repetitive resonance assignment and quantification tasks.
